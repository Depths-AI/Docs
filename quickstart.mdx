## Setup

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing your python projects. It allows you to seamlessly manage dependencies at a project level, without disturbing your global python installation.

### Install uv if you are currently pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Create a new <u>uv</u> project

Run the following command at the intended location for your project to setup a new uv project.

```bash
uv init
```

### Create a new virtual environment

```bash
uv venv
```

### Add gyaan

```bash
uv add gyaan
```

## Create your first vector store

With the environment set up, let us now create our first gyaan vector storage. Since gyaan is an on-disk vector store (vector embeddings are read from the disk on-demand), it is prudent to keep most operations async.

Therefore, to use gyaan, we have to use the async mode in python. Let us create our first vector store:

<CodeGroup>

```python Bare minimum
import asyncio
from gyaan import VectorStorage

async def main():
    vector_store = await VectorStorage.create(
        vector_path="first_store",
        embedding_dim=1536)

asyncio.run(main())
```


```python With more metadata
import asyncio
from gyaan import VectorStorage

async def main():
    vector_store = await VectorStorage.create(
        vector_path="first_store",
        embedding_dim=1536,
        title="Your specified title for this store",
        description="You can also add some description",
        store_id="abcdefgh", # you can specify a custom store ID
        keywords=["depths-ai","gyaan","vector database"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Explanation" icon="sparkles" iconType="regular">
  1. The `create()` class method creates a new `VectorStorage` object, that you can use later in your code. It assigns a random UUIDv6 as the store_id to this object, for time-stamped uniqueness.
  2. You have to specify the relative path for storage and the dimension of your vector embeddings upfront as the bare minimum params.
  3. It also creates 4 directories inside the specified relative path. In our case, we specify the path as "first_store", which would create a sub-directory titled "first_store" in the directory where you are running your python script. 
  4. These 4 directories are: (a) **kv**: stores the actual embedding (key) and file path (value) pairs (b) **files**: The "values" or the information for which you are generating embeddings. This style allows us to store multi-modal vector embedding stores, allowing file to be of any format (c) **metadata**: The "definition" of the vector store (d) **index**: Index for your vector embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval.
  5. The `create()` also allows you to specify additional metadata information like title, description, keywords, and even a custom store_id, which is useful when you want to attach a vector store to a particular AI Agent or your app's user via their ID.
